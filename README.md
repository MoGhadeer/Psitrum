**Psitrum** is an open-source software that allows the user to design, implement and simulate quantum circuits. Then, it gives the user a variety of visualization tools that help him to understand and analyze the results.

**Psitrum** is simply a **simulator** that simulate the process of universal quantum computers. 


## Psitrum Services
Psitrum allows the user:
- to design a quantum circuit with as many qubit and as many operations.
- to simulate the output of the quantum circuit designed
- to add different types of noise into teh circuit
- to provide visualizations to the results (e.g. Bloch Sphere)
- to trace the quantum state of each qubit after each stage
- to import and export quantum circuits.

## Psitrum Repository

Psitrum repository contains three components:
1. Psitrum Installation Files {Psitrum_Installation}
2. Psitrum MATLAB source codes {Psitrum_Code}
3. Psitrum documentations and designing files {Documentation}

## Installation
You can download Psitrum by three ways:
### Psitrum: Standalone App
This is the easiest method to use Psitrum. You can install the app by following those steps:
1. Download the installer file (PsitrumInstaller)
2. Follow the installation instruction of the installer
3. Start using Psitrum

### Psitrum: MATLAB App
By this method you can add Psitrum as an App in your Matlab software:
1. Download the matlab app installer (Psitrum.mlappinstall)
2. Open MATLAB in your computer and go the Apps section
3. Click on "Install App" and chose the downloaded file
4. Now, it is installed and you can find it in "My Apps" section
5. Start using Psitrum

### Psitrum: App Designer
You can use this method if you want to access the code of Psitrum and start develop it:
1. Download the Code file (PsitrumCode) as .zip extension
2. Unzip the file and save it wherever you want
3. Open MATLAB in your computer
4. Change the "Current Folder" into the downloaded file
5. Now, you can find the functions of Psitrum and other folders 
6. Open the file (Psitrum.mlapp) to access the App designer of Psitrum
7. You can start learning and developing Psitrum code
